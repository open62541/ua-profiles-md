# Supported Features

This file lists the implementation status of conformance units of the stack.
These conformance units can be grouped in:

- Categories
- Conformance Groups
- Profiles and Facets 

In addition the current CTT (Compliance Test Tools) results are given.

## Explanation

 * Not Implemented = :new_moon:
 * Being Implemented = :waning_crescent_moon:
 * Incubating = :last_quarter_moon:
 * Stable = :full_moon:
 * Certified = :heavy_check_mark:

The following tables use these signs to indicate the test results:
 * Error = :x:
 * Warning = :warning:
 * Not Implemented = :heavy_minus_sign:
 * Skipped = :white_circle:
 * Not Supported = :radio_button:
 * OK = :heavy_check_mark:
 * Back Trace = :collision:
 * No test results = :grey_question:
